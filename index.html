            <span>by Jason Crabb</span>
            <p class="p">
                I can't tell you why you're walking through this valley <br>
                I can't tell you just how long you've got to stay <br>
                I can't tell you why your heart feels so unsettled <br>
                Or when this all will change <br>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                But I can tell you there is something you can lean on <br>
                It's a promise that won't bend and it won't break <br>
                It will keep you when the future isn't certain <br>
                You're not out of grace <br>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Coro: When the darkness overwhelms you, and the fear just won't subside <br>
                When your questions out weigh answers, on those long and lonely nights <br>
                When you've got to keep on moving, He is with you in the valley of despair <br>
                And He won't leave you there <br>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                He is with you when you think you just won't make it <br>
                And He is right there when it looks like hope is lost <br>
                You're gonna find out He's nothing less than faithful <br>
                So keep holing on, keep holding on <br>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Corus:
            </p>
        
            <p class="p">
                There has never been a moment, there will never be a day <br>
                He's not strong enough to rescue, He's not strong enough to save <br>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Oh, When the darkness overwhelms you, and the fear just won't subside <br>
                When your questions out weigh answers, on those long and lonely nights <br>
                When you've got to keep on moving, He is with you in the valley of despair <br>
                And He won't leave you there <br>
            </p>
